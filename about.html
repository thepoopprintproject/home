    <h2>About Our Project</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m a student in Geneva who loves 3D printing and helping others. This project started as a way to reduce waste from my hobby and has grown into a community effort to provide free, sensory-friendly tools to people who need them. The fidgets are made from recycled filament scraps and distributed at no cost to residents in Geneva.</p>
    <p><strong>Values:</strong> Free, Eco-friendly, Community-driven. This is a volunteer initiative, not a business, and it’s built around the people who need calm and comfort.</p>

    <h2>Why I Do It</h2>
    <p>As someone who experiences anxiety, I know how powerful a simple, tactile tool can be. By turning waste into something useful, I hope to spark a little calm in our community while reducing environmental waste.</p>
