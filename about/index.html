                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Small 3D printers waste around 20% of their filament as unusable scraps. At the same time, anxiety is one of the most common mental health challenges worldwide‚Äîincluding in Geneva. The Poop Print Project connects these two challenges in a positive way.</p>

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>By creating free fidget tools from printer waste, the project:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduces unnecessary landfill use</li>
                        <li>Supports mental health and daily well-being</li>
                        <li>Inspires others to see waste as a resource, not rubbish</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Personal Quote</h2>
                    <p><strong>‚ÄúI never thought I‚Äôd be helping people while also solving my printer‚Äôs waste issue. This project changed how I see both sustainability and mental health.‚Äù ‚Äì Project Founder</strong></p>
                    
                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>This project was born out of a deep interest in 3D printing, sustainability, and mental health support. Through personal experience, I came to understand how effective fidget tools can be in managing anxiety and improving focus.</p>
                    
                    <p>This project started when I noticed how much filament waste my 3D printer produced. Those small blobs and failed prints (we call them "poops" in the 3D printing community) were piling up, heading straight for the trash. Meanwhile, I was spending money on store-bought fidgets that weren't always affordable or effective.</p>
                    
                    <p>That's when it clicked: <strong>Why not turn this waste into something useful for the community?</strong></p>

                    <h2>How I Ensure Quality & Safety</h2>
                    <p>While these fidgets are made from "waste" material, I take safety seriously:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Non-toxic materials only:</strong> Made with safe PLA (biodegradable) and PETG (durable, skin-safe).</li>
                        <li><strong>Smooth edges:</strong> Every fidget is checked for sharp points or rough surfaces</li>
                        <li><strong>Clean workspace:</strong> All materials are handled in a clean, organized environment</li>
                        <li><strong>Age considerations:</strong> Parents should supervise young children with any fidget tool</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>
                    <p>Unlike commercial fidget toys, every piece from The Poop Print Project is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Completely free</strong> ‚Äì no hidden costs, no "donations required"</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmentally conscious</strong> ‚Äì made from genuine waste material</li>
                        <li><strong>Locally produced</strong> ‚Äì 3D printed using open-source designs</li>
                        <li><strong>Anxiety-informed</strong> ‚Äì selected and tested by someone who actually uses fidgets daily</li>
                    </ul>
